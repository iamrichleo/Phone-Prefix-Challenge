### Installing

Install the packages by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Building

To build the files, you have two defined scripts:

- `pnpm dev`: Builds and creates a local server that serves all files (check [Serving files on development mode](#serving-files-on-development-mode) for more info).
- `pnpm build`: Builds to the production directory (`dist`).
